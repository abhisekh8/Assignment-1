//Develop a Java-based College Management System to model the relationship between
colleges and students. Create a College class with attributes collegeName and
collegeLoc, and a Student class with studentId, studentName, and a reference to a
College object. Implement a constructor in Student to initialize these attributes and a
displayStudentInfo() method to print student and college details. In the MainApp
class, instantiate at least two College and Student objects, enroll each student in one of
the colleges, and display all details using appropriate methods.



class College {
    String collegeName;
    String collegeLoc;

    
    public College(String collegeName, String collegeLoc) {
        this.collegeName = collegeName;
        this.collegeLoc = collegeLoc;
    }
}


class Student {
    int studentId;
    String studentName;
    College college;


    public Student(int studentId, String studentName, College college) {
        this.studentId = studentId;
        this.studentName = studentName;
        this.college = college;
    }

   
    public void displayStudentInfo() {
        System.out.println("Student ID: " + studentId);
        System.out.println("Student Name: " + studentName);
        System.out.println("Enrolled College: " + college.collegeName);
        System.out.println("College Location: " + college.collegeLoc);
      
    }
}


public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       
        College college1 = new College("SOA University", "BBSR");
        College college2 = new College("IIT DELHI", "Delhi");

       
        Student student1 = new Student(344, "unknown", college1);
        Student student2 = new Student(666, "Dontknow", college2);

       
        student1.displayStudentInfo();
        student2.displayStudentInfo();
    }
}
